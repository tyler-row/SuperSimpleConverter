# `Super Simple Converter`

### *A super easy CLI program for easily converting a select few or many files at once; from one type to another, with very minimal user input* 

## What this does:
- Uses `ffmpeg` for quick and easy video & audio conversion
- Uses `puremagic` for video identification on the different file-types 
---
# How to use:
- Download the required prerequisites by opening a terminal in the destination of the `SSC.py` file, and run (pc) `py -m pip install -r requirements.txt` or `pyhton3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Place the `SSC.py` in the location of the files you wish to convert. Run the program by typing `py SSC.py` or `python3 SSC.py`** 
---
# Possible Future Additions:
1. **Not needing to have the `SSC.py` file in the location of files planned to be converted**
2. **Option to delete the pre-converted original file, to save space**
3. **Basic GUI front-end**
